IDidThat is an application where users can discover the coolest places around

It is a Succinct and anonymous network, that allows users to anonymously check-in and rate any place be it a restaurant, hotel, amusement park or even a workplace. Succinctness promotes people to quickly review any place, rather having to write a review. Anonymity enables honest reviews.
Data consumers find to-the-point, honest reviews, in straight numbers. This eliminates the hassle of reading reviews to find out if the place is popular. 
The check ins will be based on location and categories, so anybody looking for location based or category based reviews, they can narrow down their search and find what they are looking.
